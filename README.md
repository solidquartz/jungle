# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 6.1 for purposes of teaching Rails by example. I implemented various bug fixes and implemented new features using a language and framework I was unfamiliar with to learn on the job. This project also features Stripe.

## Dependencies

- Rails 6.1
- Bootstrap 5
- PostgreSQL 9.x
- Stripe
